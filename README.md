# celebritydeadoralive

Pitch: I'm always arguing with my friends over celebrities who have come and gone. I want to game to determine who knows best- once and for all!


MVP: As a user I can take the quiz without having to log in. The Quiz will start and there will be a timer and a celebrity picture and name with two buttons "Dead" and "Alive". The user will then be able to guess as to whether or not that celebrity is still living. Once they finish the quiz a modal will pop up to show them their score. If the user wants their score to persist in the system, they'll have to sign up and log in at that point.

Stretch: Aggregate the data collected from the user taking the quiz to take account for the time it took to answer the question. The faster they took, the higher the score for the correct answer.

Allow users to share the results of their quizzes on a social media platform of your choice.
